# Programming-for-Data-Science-assignments

These files are short algorithms that I implemented for my Programming for Data Science module during my degree. Unfortunately I cannot share the questions I am actually answering in these assignments for copyright reasons, but I believe this demonstrates my abilities well enough without it.

Assignment 1 focusses on simple sorting algorithms

Assignment 2 focusses on two strategies for the classic reinforcement learning situation known as the "two-armed bandit". https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multi-armed_bandit heres a link for more information

Assignemnt 3 focusses on implementing a mathematical optimisation method known as gradient descent. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent
